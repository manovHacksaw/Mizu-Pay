# 🚨 URGENT: Database Schema Fix Required

## Current Issue
Your payment system is failing because the database schema is missing the `txHash` field. The error shows:

```
Unknown argument `txHash`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

## ✅ Solution: Database Migration

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**
Open a new terminal/command prompt in your project directory and run:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### **Step 2: Restart Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: Test Payment Flow**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/payment`
2. Make a test payment
3. Verify payment saves successfully
4. Check email confirmation

## 🔧 Alternative Methods

### **Method 1: Batch File**
I've created a batch file for you:
```bash
# Run the batch file
scripts/run-prisma-migration.bat
```

### **Method 2: Manual Commands**
If you have permission issues, try:
```bash
# Use Command Prompt instead of PowerShell
cmd /c "npx prisma db push"
cmd /c "npx prisma generate"
```

### **Method 3: VS Code Terminal**
1. Open VS Code
2. Open integrated terminal
3. Run the commands there

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### **Before (Current Error):**
- ❌ Payment API fails with "Unknown argument `txHash`"
- ❌ Payment not saved to database
- ❌ Email sent but payment data lost

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ Payment API accepts `txHash` field
- ✅ Payment record saved with transaction hash
- ✅ Email confirmation sent successfully
- ✅ Complete payment flow working

## 📊 Schema Changes Applied

The `prisma/schema.prisma` file has been updated with:

```prisma
model Payment {
  // ... existing fields ...
  txHash       String?          // ← NEW FIELD ADDED
  // ... rest of fields ...
}
```

## 🚀 Expected Results

After migration, your payment system will work perfectly:

1. **Payment Success** → Transaction confirmed on blockchain
2. **Database Save** → Payment record saved with txHash
3. **Email Sent** → Confirmation email sent via Resend
4. **User Notification** → "Payment successful! Confirmation email sent."

## 🧪 Testing After Migration

### **Test Payment Flow:**
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/payment`
3. Connect wallet to CELO Sepolia
4. Make test payment
5. Verify payment saves to database
6. Check email confirmation in Gmail

### **Verify Database:**
- Payment record should include `txHash` field
- No more "Unknown argument" errors
- Email confirmations working

## 🚨 If Migration Still Fails

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Permission Error**: Run terminal as administrator
2. **Database Connection**: Check DATABASE_URL in .env
3. **Prisma Not Found**: Run `npm install prisma @prisma/client`

### **Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Check Prisma installation
npm list prisma

# Check database connection
npx prisma db pull

# Reset database (if needed)
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```
