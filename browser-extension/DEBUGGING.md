## Still Not Working?

If the button still doesn't appear:

1. **Try the simplified content script**:
   - Replace `content.js` with `content-simple.js`
   - Reload the extension

2. **Check browser compatibility**:
   - Make sure you're using Chrome (not Firefox, Safari, etc.)
   - Update Chrome to the latest version

3. **Check for conflicts**:
   - Disable other extensions temporarily
   - Try in incognito mode

4. **Manual button creation**:
   - Use the "Force Show Button" feature
   - This bypasses detection and creates the button manually

## Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the console** for error messages
2. **Try the debug tools** provided
3. **Test with the simple test page** first
4. **Make sure your DApp is running** on localhost:3000

The extension should work with the test pages provided. If it doesn't work there, there's a configuration issue that needs to be resolved first.
